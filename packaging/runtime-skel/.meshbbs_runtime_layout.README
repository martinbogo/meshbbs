This directory contains the runtime skeleton that gets included in release artifacts:
- bin/meshbbs (added during packaging, not stored here)
- config.example.toml (copied from this folder)
- data/files/, data/messages/, data/users/ (created here via .keep files)

Do not add real user data or logs here. These are just empty directories to make the app runnable out-of-the-box after extraction.
