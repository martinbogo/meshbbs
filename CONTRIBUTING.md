# Contributing to MeshBBS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MeshBBS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Git
- A Meshtastic device for testing (optional but recommended)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/meshbbs.git
   cd meshbbs
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
5. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow standard Rust formatting using `rustfmt`:
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```
- Use `clippy` to catch common issues:
  ```bash
  cargo clippy
  ```
- Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Add documentation for public APIs

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Testing

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test with actual Meshtastic hardware when possible
- Document any new testing procedures

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Rust version, hardware)
- Relevant log output

### Feature Requests

For new features:
- Describe the use case and motivation
- Provide detailed specifications when possible
- Consider backwards compatibility
- Discuss implementation approach

### Code Contributions

1. **Small fixes**: Direct pull requests are welcome
2. **New features**: Please open an issue first to discuss
3. **Breaking changes**: Require discussion and planning

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation as needed
2. Add or update tests for your changes
